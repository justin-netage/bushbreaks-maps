Display lodge accommodations from a Pods custom post type on a map, with search and a featured list.

== Description ==

Bushbreaks Maps adds a `[bushbreaks_map]` shortcode that renders:

* A search bar
* A list of featured accommodations
* An interactive Leaflet map showing every accommodation with coordinates

The plugin reads from a Pods custom post type (default slug `accommodation`) and pulls latitude/longitude from configurable post meta fields. No API key required — uses OpenStreetMap tiles by default.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `bushbreaks-maps` directory to `/wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate the plugin in **Plugins**.
3. Visit **Settings → Bushbreaks Maps** to configure the post type and field names.
4. Add `[bushbreaks_map]` to any page.

== Shortcode ==

`[bushbreaks_map height="600px"]`

== Changelog ==

= 0.8.1 =
* New "Region filter" toggle in Settings → Bushbreaks Maps. Uncheck to hide the front-end region dropdown without removing the taxonomy or term ordering data.

= 0.8.0 =
* Tokenized, case-insensitive search across title, content, location text, and destination term names. Multi-word queries match when each word appears in any searchable field; partial words match too (e.g. "krug" finds "Kruger").

= 0.7.9 =
* Change plugin author to Net Age.

= 0.7.8 =
* Re-cut release so the tagged commit contains the bumped version metadata; PUC can now detect the update.

= 0.7.7 =
* Sync plugin header and readme version metadata so the GitHub-based update checker correctly detects new releases.

= 0.7.5 =
* Initial release.
